# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
It is a project in which I try to translate my knowledge in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Sass.

## Content
The content of the project is divided into HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Sass files. 
The HTML files are divided into two:
- The first one contains the main page.
- The second contains the game.

This project has only one CSS file which was processed from several .scss files, And finally the .js files are divided in three:
- The first one helps us to switch pages.
- The second one for the dark mode.
- The third one contains all the game logic.
